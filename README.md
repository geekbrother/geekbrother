### 💪 Work principles and methods: 
You need to know your team's work and how the things and certain technology work! That's why in most cases when I've been CTO I'm acting as a full stack developer too (part-time only, management is a first priority). Smaller, but motivated and smarter team - my priority in the projects.

I prefer to choose between Agile and Waterfall method depending on the project and it development stage using Jira, Redmine, Github Projects and Issues.

### 🛵  Hobby: 
- While I'm not coding or assembling something new all in wires, I like 🚴‍♂️ cycling, 🏄‍♂️ surfing (thanks to Bali) and 🏂 snowboarding (very rare if to be honest, I prefer the sun). I like travel and this is my biggest investment now. You need to know the world from different angels to make something new for the people.

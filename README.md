üèó A few of my libraries at [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/lib/search?query=owner:geekmaks).
- [![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-12100E?style=flat-square&logo=medium&logoColor=white)](https://geekmaks.medium.com) üë®‚Äçüíª Sometimes I'm writing for "Frontend Weekly" and "The Startup" at [Medium](https://geekmaks.medium.com/).
- ü´∂ **I‚Äôm looking** to collaborate on cool projects about cloud computing, IoT, Web3, blockchain, distributed computing and storage, databases, or social impact spheres.

## üå± I‚Äôm mostly and recently working with:

- ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=flat-square&logo=rust&logoColor=white) **2.5 years**: 
  
  Made a fleet of backends in Rust and their integrations into NodeJS, ReactNative, and C++ for [Comm.app](https://github.com/CommE2E/comm) (NY-based startup, web3 discord alternative with e2e). Heavily used [Tokio.rs](https://tokio.rs) (Tonic, Axum, Tracing), [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/), [cxx.rs](https://cxx.rs/). 
  
  Created a [cxx-corrosion-cmake](https://github.com/geekbrother/cxx-corrosion-cmake) which is one of the examples in the [cxx.rs official documentation](https://cxx.rs/build/cmake.html).

- ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white) **3 years:**

  Backend for [ServerPanel.io](https://serverpanel.io) (SF-based startup, Virtual Machines, and cloud automation), and [Relly.me](https://github.com/rellydev) (IoT smart locks for homes, public parkings, and offices). Heavily used [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) especially for websockets and [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm).

-  ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=flat-square&logo=c&logoColor=white) ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=flat-square&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) **~7 years:** 

    Rewriting C++ backend services into Rust in [Comm.app](https://comm.app), firmware for MCUs (ESP, STM) in [Relly.me](https://relly.me), microservices in [VDS64.com](https://vds64.com). Heavily used [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) from Facebook and [Boost](https://www.boost.org/).

- ![ReactNative](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Native-20232A?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=flat-square&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) **~7 years:**
  
  Integrating C++ and Rust libraries into NodeJS backend services in [Comm.app](https://comm.app). ReactNative Mobile apps for [Relly.me](https://relly.me), [Slavena.pro](https://slavena.pro). Backend services in [VDS64.com](https://vds64.com) and [Relly.me](https://relly.me). Used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [mobx-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome) for state management in ReactNative applications.

- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=flat-square&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E) ![Flow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flow-EF873F?style=flat-square) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=flat-square&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) **~15 years:**
  
  I started with vanilla JS when I worked as a web developer at the start of my career. Then JQuery and goes on... I used Flow when working with the [Comm.app](https://comm.app) codebase while integrating the Rust codebase into the ReactNative mobile app. TypeScript was partially used in ReactNative in [Relly.me](https://relly.me).

- ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-00000F?style=flat-square&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) ![MariaDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MariaDB-003545?style=flat-square&logo=mariadb&logoColor=white) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=flat-square&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-07405E?style=flat-square&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white) **~ 10 years with SQL databases:**

  I worked with MySQL since my first project in my life, then switched to PostgreSQL. TimeScale was used for time series data in IoT projects and Cloud Automation for statistics. Encrypted SQLite as an embedded database was used in [Comm.app](https://comm.app). Also, I created and maintained [SQLCipher amalgamation package](https://github.com/CommE2E/sqlcipher-amalgamation) for use in iOS builds.

- ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white) ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/redis-%23DD0031.svg?&style=flat-square&logo=redis&logoColor=white) ![AWS DynamoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon%20DynamoDB-4053D6?style=flat-square&logo=Amazon%20DynamoDB&logoColor=white) ![InfluxDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/InfluxDB-22ADF6?style=flat-square&logo=InfluxDB&logoColor=white) **~7 years with NoSQL databases:**

  DynamoDB was used in a [Comm.app](https://comm.app) project as a messaging storage layer. Heavily used MongoDB in [Relly.me](https://relly.me) project for storing user-defined data. Redis was used in [Comm.app](https://comm.app) for caching and in [VDS64.com](https://vds64.com) as a caching layer and pub-sub. InfluxDB was used as a time series database for statistics in IoT and cloud automation in [ServerPanel.io](https://serverpanel.io).

- ![RabbitMQ](https://img.shields.io/badge/rabbitmq-%23FF6600.svg?&style=flat-square&logo=rabbitmq&logoColor=white) **~7 years:**

  RabbitMQ is a main messages bus in [Comm.app](https://comm.app) where I used it with NodeJS, C++, and Rust microservices. It's heavily used in [VDS64.com](https://vds64.com) facilities and as a primary communication layer for IoT devices in [Relly.me](https://relly.me).

- ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_AWS-232F3E?style=flate-square&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white) ![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/terraform-%235835CC.svg?style=flat-square&logo=terraform&logoColor=white) ![Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-000000?style=flat_square&logo=vercel&logoColor=white) ![CloudFalare](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cloudflare-F38020?style=flat-square&logo=Cloudflare&logoColor=white) **~7 years with public cloud services:**

  Deploying to AWS (ECS, S3, DynamoDB) using the Terraform when working in [Comm.app](https://comm.app). Used Cloudflare Edge Functions and KV store in [VDS64.com](https://vds64.com), [Relly.me](https://relly.me). Deployed to Vercel [Slavena.pro](https://slavena.pro).

- ![GraphQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GraphQL-E10098?style=flat-square&logo=graphql&logoColor=white) ![gRPC](https://img.shields.io/badge/gRPC-6DA8AE?style=flat-square) ![protobuf](https://img.shields.io/badge/protobuf-45965C?style=flat-square) ![REST](https://img.shields.io/badge/REST-0E294C?style=flat-square) ![websocket](https://img.shields.io/badge/websocket-E66C2C?style=flat-square)

  I have been using REST since the first webdev project, also I have used websocket if we need a subscription. GraphQL was first used in the NashDom.app project for the backend and React Native mobile application communication including subscription. gRPC with protobuf is used in the [Comm.app](https://comm.app) project where I used it for the microservices and backend -> React Native communication including bidirectional streams.

- ![GitHub Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Actions-2088FF?style=flat-square&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white) ![Jenkins](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jenkins-D24939?style=flat-square&logo=Jenkins&logoColor=white) **~10 years with CI, CD:**

  Used Jenkins for years until GitHub Actions was released and switched to it then.

- ![Jira](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jira-0052CC?style=flat-square&logo=Jira&logoColor=white) ![Phabricator](https://img.shields.io/badge/phabricator-457CB4?style=flat-square) ![Graphite](https://img.shields.io/badge/graphite-000000?style=flat-square) ![Aviator](https://img.shields.io/badge/aviator.co-F9DD73?style=flat-square) ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=flat-square&logo=git&logoColor=white) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=white) **~10 years with project management and code review tools:** 

  Woking with the PRs (GitHub PR), stacked PRs (Aviator.co), and stacked Diffs (Phabricator, Facebook, and Google practice) approaches. Personally, I'm sure that stacked Diffs or stacked PRs following the **KISS** principle are the best approaches for code review. Jira or any other task-tracking software including Notion is totally on my list.

- ![Grafana](https://img.shields.io/badge/grafana-%23F46800.svg?style=flat-square&logo=grafana&logoColor=white) ![Sentry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sentry-E85237?style=flat-square) ![LogRocket](https://img.shields.io/badge/LogRocket-6F4CB6?style=flat-square) **~7 years with monitoring and metrics:**

  Grafana was used for monitoring, logs aggregation (using Loki), and metrics for backend services in most of my projects. I used Sentry for the frontend and mobile apps but switched to use LogRocket instead for ReactNative.

- ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=flat-square&logo=docker&logoColor=white) ![Nix](https://img.shields.io/badge/NIX-5277C3.svg?style=flat-square&logo=NixOS&logoColor=white) **~5 years with app containerizations:**

  I grew up in a hosting company and we heavily used our VMs and deployed the code using the repo sync and build tools such as PM2. But in recent years Docker has been heavily used everywhere, so I used it 100%. Also, I've used [Nix](https://nixos.org/) in my recent work in [Comm.app](https://comm.app) for reproducible builds and deployments.

## üóø Work principles and methods: 

I'm a big fan of the **TDD**, **BDD** everywhere it's possible. When I first attended a meetup at Twitter HQ, I
really fell in love with the **Pizza Margherita** principle which is actually a **KISS** + **YAGNI**
principles. Following **SOLID** and **DRY** is a must. 

When speaking in team management I'm always following
a **responsibility segregation** principle instead of task segregation among the team members.

## üí¨ I have other experience in / ask me about:

  - **Product Architect and Design.**

## üåÅ Work timeline:

  - ***2002 - 2006***: Kharkiv Information System, üìç Ukraine, Kharkiv / Hybrid Part-time (Web sites development). 
    
    Full-stack web developer. Made a big bunch of websites using PHP, MySQL, and JQuery as a full-stack developer. I made a small framework called [ngMySQL](https://github.com/geekbrother/ngMySQL) at that time to bind Angular and MySQL for the admin web-ui.

  - ***2006 - 2009***: Webspace.com.ua, üìç Ukraine, Kharkiv / Onsite (Shared hosting).
    
    Full-stack web developer and Linux administrator (Part-time).

  - ***2010 - 2019***: VDS64.com, üìç Ukraine, Kyiv / Onsite ‚û°Ô∏è Part-time remote (Virtual machines and bare-metal servers hosting).
  
    I joined the company as a full-stack developer with PHP and MySQL and then grew to the system engineer and company CTO. R&D for the cloud control software and hardware integration. Own cloud expansion and distribution to three countries (Ukraine, Germany, Russia). Managed the engineering team (all remote): frontend developers, backend developers, server hardware engineers, and heavy-duty 24x7 support team. Learned and used in production software created in C++, NodeJS, and Golang. Engineered critical distributed systems like DNS service.

  - ***2015 - 2017***: ServerPanel.io, üìç USA, Bay Area, San Francisco / Onsite (OpenVZ and proxmox cloud automation software).
  
    Backend team lead. Acting as a full-stack developer as well. Team management: frontend (Angular then React), backend (mostly Golang with a minor in Python and DevOps). Not so much can be shared because of NDA. The company was acquired on the final stage of the development.

  - ***2017 - 2019***: NashDom.app, üìç Ukraine, Kyiv / Hybrid (IoT automation for households and offices).
  
    Team Lead, founding engineer. Frontend and Mobile Application was developed using React/React Native. Backend services consist of Golang and NodeJS distributed microservices. We used RabbitMQ as the main communication bus and PostgreSQL for the user data storage. InfluxDB was used for monitoring and analysis. We processed nearly 2-10 requests per second of the user's activity.

  - ***2020 - 2021***: Relly.me, üìç Germany, Berlin / Remote, Hybrid (Successor of the NashDom.app with the own hardware and firmware). 
  
    Founding engineer. Additionally to the NashDom.app we started to R&D the hardware for home and office automation. R&D included PCB design, C++ MCU (ESP and STM) firmware, plastic cases design and manufacturing, hardware assembly and packaging, and distribution across existing customers. Revamping the customer's mobile app using the updated ReactNative and new UI design. Switching to MongoDB for user data along with PostgreSQL and TimeScale for time-series data. The backend was refactored in Golang and NodeJS to fix previous design flaws.

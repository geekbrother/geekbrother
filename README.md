  - **Relly.me** Smart home system for apartment blocks with software (Mobile App), Backend and hardware parts. 🟡 Active development, partly running
    - As for now three hardware items in production: 
      - Small one port wifi relay module based on esp8266 (Firmware: C++/PlatformIO + VueJS for webgui).
      - 8 port smart relay module with encryption and display based on esp32 (Firmware: C++/PlatformIO + VueJS for webgui).
      - Smart wifi doorbell based on esp32 with camera module (Firmware: C++/PlatformIO).
    - User Mobile IOS and Android App (ReactNative/Expo, API GraphQL).
    - Backend based on NodeJS service with CloudFlare workers and KV storage. Database MongoDB for user data and TimeScaleDB for logging and analytics. MQ RabbitMQ.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning/working with: C++20, **JS**(you must learn it all the time), **TypeScript 4**, **React**, MCU programming (platformIO, C, C++) and a bunch of other things include Chinese 🤠

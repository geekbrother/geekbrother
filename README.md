### 🧙🏼‍♂️ Team Management:
I prefer managing a small team of developers (up to 10) or managing 2nd layer Team Leads of brunches to achieve the best results. Minimum meetings nad more results. Monday and Thursday meetings are the best suite in development in my practice. 

### 🥱 I don't like:
  - Svelte (terrible experience in production, [read my experience](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/svelte-3-new-vue-killer-but-not-today-8de9c88c186b)),
  - Java (old dinosaur),
  - C# (mhe...),
  - People that don't love what they do.

### 💪 Work principles and methods: 
You need to know your team's work and how the things and certain technology work! That's why in most cases when I've been Founding Engineer I'm acting as a full stack developer too (part-time only, management is a first priority). Smaller, but motivated and smarter team - my priority in the projects.

I prefer to choose between Agile and Waterfall method depending on the project and it development stage using Jira, Redmine, Github Projects and Issues.

### 🛵  Hobby: 
- While I'm not coding or assembling something new all in wires, I like 🚴‍♂️ cycling, 🏄‍♂️ surfing (thanks to Bali) and 🏂 snowboarding (very rare if to be honest, I prefer the sun). I like travel and this is my biggest investment now. You need to know the world from different angels to make something new for the people.
